                <p>The UV assembly consists of a UV curing lamp (<a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=SOLIS-365C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">High-Power LED for Microscopy 365 nm (UV) 3.0 W (Min)</a>) on a post, pointed downward. The UV curing lamp is driven by a power controller (<a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=DC20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">High-Power Driver for Solis LEDs 10 A Max 14.0 V Max</a>). To turn on the UV lamp, press the button on the power controller. To change the intensity on the lamp, turn the button on the power controller. The power controller can be plugged into a regular outlet.</p>
                <p>Below the UV lamp is a sensor which can be swung out of the way to make room for the stage. The sensor can detect light of a range of wavelengths and intensities. The sensor is attached to a <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=PM120VA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PM120VA</a> control box. The power button is on the left of the box. The user must choose a wavelength to detect. The wavelength of the UV lamp is 365 nm. The sensor box can be plugged into a regular outlet.</p>
